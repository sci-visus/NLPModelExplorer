Interactive Visualization and Manipulation of Attention-based Neural Machine Translation
\textcolor{blue}{Lee visualizes the beam search and attention component in the NMT model. The work allows user involve into the decision-making process by enabling dynamic change the probability for the next step of the search tree or change the weight value of the attention.}

End-to-End Non-Factoid Question Answering with an Interactive Visualization of Neural Attention Weights
\textcolor{blue}{Instead of visualizing the attention matrix directly, the system shows the text context and highlights the critical phrase, which used to answers the questions, using color map. In this platform, user able to use the visual feature to compare the benefit and drawback of multiple attention based neural network model.}
