\section{Discussion}
In this work, we introduce a visualization library for creating customized environments that allow the user to interrogate the relationship between different parts of the model pipeline via interactive queries.
%
We demonstrate the usability and flexibility of tool by configuring the visual components to investigate models for solving different NLP tasks (e.g., NLI, MC).
%
We also conducted a small-scale user study, in which we ask several Ph.D. level student with NLP background to spend 30 minutes with the tool and provide feedback. The positive feedbacks mentioned the environment allow them to iteratively refine their queries and identify potential issues with the model, but some student also suggests the tool may not provide enough guidance for user do not have an in-depth understanding of the model.

We design the individual components with versatility in mind. However, due to a large number of variants of attention networks, it is hard to ensure the current interface is compatible with all the available configurations.
%
In the future, we plan to improve the flexibility of the attention interface and expand the visualization component further to handle tasks such neural machine translation and more.
