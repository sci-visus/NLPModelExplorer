\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Neural-network-based end-to-end models have gained unprecedented popularity in natural language processing, despite their impressive performance, the lack of interpretability hinder the development and refinement of the model.
%
In this work, we present a flexible visualization library for creating customized visual analytic environment that allow the user to explore the model internals (i.e., attention) and interrogate the model decision making process.
