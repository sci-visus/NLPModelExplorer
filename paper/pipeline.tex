\section{NLIVis Design}
We describe the design of the NLIVis system, which address the visualization tasks described in the previous section. 
%
First, we discuss the perturbation-driven paradigm that is central to the achieving the visualization tasks.
%
Then, we describe in detail the five major components of the proposed system, namely, all pair summary view, sentence view, attention view, prediction view, pipeline view. 

% Beside looking into the internal states, understanding how each of the component of the model interact with input and output as well as with each other is the crucial for truly examine the mechanism of the model.
%
% Look at how the model work in action and interrogate relationship between different component, i.e., how the change made to one part of model affect the other pieces present, is the key to gain the full picture.
