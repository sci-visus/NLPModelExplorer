\subsection{Input Perturbation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Just looking at the failure cases is not enough, the prediction maybe correct for the wrong reason
    \item sensitivity of the model with respect of
\end{itemize}


Iterate the model design and debug the system hinged on the ability to quickly and identify the errors made by a model.

Perturbation the input is what NLP researchers have subconsciously been doing to study and test a model.

Interpret/probe the relationship between attention and the prediction result
