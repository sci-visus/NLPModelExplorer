\subsection{All Pairs Summary View}
\label{sec:allPairs}
Since we can only focus on one individual example at a time for detail analysis, 
how to pick an single pair of sentence from the development or test dataset (for the SNLI dataset, each of the these set consists of close to $10k$ examples) is an obvious challenge.
%
In addition, we also want to obtain certain high-level understand of how the whole set behave, beyond the information the prediction accuracy provide.

%The all pair
\begin{itemize}
\item How to go from 10k pair to one pair
\item What constitute interesting example
\item How to get a sense of overall prediction result
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sentence View}
The sentence view shows the premise and hypothesis sentences, and in case of the existence of perturbation, highlight the where in the sentence the perturbation happens.

Add user customized sentences.

\begin{itemize}
\item Examine perturbed pair
\item See which word is perturbed in a sentence
\item Add to existing example collection
\end{itemize}
