\section{Application Story}
\label{sec:caseStudy}
% \shusen{A full case study that driven by the visualization task and the question associated with them}
In this section, we utilizes the perturbation based analysis to illustrate how the proposed system can help the domain experts making sense of attention mechanism and assess the behavior of the model.

\subsection{Is the Prediction Stable?}
\shusen{difference in sensitivity among entail netural and contradict relationships}

\subsection{Where Are the Mistakes?}

\subsection{How Attention Affect the Prediction?}

\subsection{What Does It Take to Change the Prediction?}

\subsection{Is Attention All You Need?}
