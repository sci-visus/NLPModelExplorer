\section{Application Scenarios}
\label{sec:caseStudy}
% \shusen{A full case study that driven by the visualization task and the question associated with them}
In this section, we discuss application scenarios, in which the domain experts utilize the perturbation driven analysis to explore and assess the model and interpret the attention mechanism.
These scenarios are summarized by the domain experts who try to integrate the tool into their workflow.

\subsection{Scenario 1: Interpreting Decision Making Process}
The three stages (encoder, attention, classifier) of the model work in synergy to produce the correct prediction.
%
Mistake can be made in either of these stages.
% \shusen{difference in sensitivity among entail natural and contradict relationships}
% the generate the correct prediction for the wrong reason

\subsection{Scenario 2: Assess the Model Prediction Stability}
Utilize input sentence perturbation to assess the overall stability of the prediction

\subsection{Scenario 3: What Does It Take to Correct the Prediction?}
In the previous section, we discussed how we can use forward prediction

\subsection{Scenario 4: Handcraft Example Analysis}
Well-known tough examples, such as the Facebook IPO example discussed in Section~\ref{sec:background}.

\subsection{Scenario 5: Grammar Structure and Attention}
Can attention capture grammar structure? Is
