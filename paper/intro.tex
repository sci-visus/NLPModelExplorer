With the recent advances in neural network based model, machine learning has gained unprecedented popularity, and its adaption permeated many fields of studies.
%
However, from researchers to practitioners, one often need to overcome many obstacles during the training, debugging, and tuning processes to unleash the full potential of these models.
%
Interpreting the internal mechanism and analyzing how predictions are made are critical to both the design and deployment of a model.
More importantly, the ability to pinpoint where and how an error is made and come up with hypothesis for the cause of failure is the key to identify the limitation and improve upon existing models.
However, providing meaningful answers to these questions are extremely challenging and often regarded as impossible by many.

Recently, substantial research has been developed to combat the model interpretability challenge. Most notably, the works~\cite{SimonyanVedaldiZisserman2013, ZeilerFergus2014, YosinskiCluneNguyen2015, OlahMordvintsevSchubert2017, LiuShiLi2017, OlahSatyanarayanJohnson2018, BilalJourablooYe2018} on interpretation of convolution neural network (CNN) model from both machine learning and visualization community has reveal the enormous potential and instant benefits of model interpretation, yet they also remind us how little we actually know regarding the inner mechanism of these deep neural network models.
%
Compare to image classification task, natural language processing systems have a number of innate restriction (e.g., the discrete nature of words) that makes the road to interpretion more treacherous. For example, \emph{feature visualization}~\cite{OlahMordvintsevSchubert2017}, an often deployed technique for illustrating what kind of image feature a given part of the network (e.g., neuron, layer, or channel) captures, can not be easily generalized and applied for natural language due to the requirement of an interpretable continuous solution space, i.e., the image pixel values, in which human user can easily recongized (or the absent of) patterns or shapes. On the other hand, even though we have the ability to encode a word as an vector~\cite{MikolovSutskeverChen2013, PenningtonSocherManning2014}, the word embedding space is still a discretely defined space, where the interpolation between two vectors (i.e., two words) do not corresponds to explicit meaning.

These restrictions that prevent the application of the well-established interprability approach to natural language models motivated us to develop the proposed perturbation-driven technique.
%
In addition, many of the existing techniques study the model as an invariant object, where the model's behaviors are recorded and analyzed in an offline fashion.
%
However, the exploratory natural of the model interpretation analysis often lead to \emph{what if ...} types of questions. What if I perturbed the current input? Will the prediction be stable? What if we change one of the key internal states of the model, how would the modification affect the prediction. What if the current prediction is wrong, how and where should we change the model parameters in order to produce the correct result? These type of dynamic queries form a natural way for us to gain understanding and come up with hypothesis of the model mechanisms by \emph{interrogating} what a componenet do by perturb it and then observe the effects on other part of the system. Therotically, we  Yet, we often need to tediously setup specialized experiment to obtain the answers.

relationship between the input, internal states, and output prediction.
In this work, we aim to provide quick and intuitive answers to these \emph{what if ...} questions. Instead of viewing the model as an invariant entitle, we employ a perturbation centric mentally to probe the model and examine how changes in one part of the pipeline affect others, which in term provide a new perspective to look at the model interpretation problem.

%Questions such as, how stable predictions are concerning small perturbation in the input, how are these predictions arrived (i.e., the model may come up with the correct prediction by pickup unintended feature/alignment), and what are the often made mistakes, are all essential in systematic examination and evaluation of the model.

%
% Interpret/probe the relationship between attention and the prediction result

% On the one hand, recognize where the model fail is non-trivial. The standard evaluation approach (i.e., the prediction accuracy on the test set) provides limited information and cannot answer many important questions (e.g., how stable the prediction is, which part of the model may contribute to the failure) that are essential to the model diagnostic process. On the other hand, infer the cause of model failure is even more challenging. Neural network models are often referred to as black boxes due to the hard to recognize  difficult to interpret parameter, hypothesizing what happened in prediction process require the ability to peek inside the model and understand the intricate relationships among model inputs, critical internal mechanisms, as well the output predictions.

The key contributions of the proposed works is summarized as the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Identify the mistakes made by the model through perturbation of input sentences and visual summarization of the predictions;

    \item Enhance the visual representation of attention by overlaying sentence linguistic structure to allow grammar guided simplification;

    \item Enable the interrogation of the relationship between input sentences, attention, and the prediction by interactively exploring how the change in one of these elements affect other parts of the model.

\end{itemize}
