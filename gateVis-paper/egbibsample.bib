@article{Guo2003,
	Abstract = {Unknown (and unexpected) multivariate patterns lurking in high-dimensional
	datasets are often very hard to find. This paper describes a human-centered
	exploration environment, which incorporates a coordinated suite of
	computational and visualization methods to explore high-dimensional
	data for uncovering patterns in multivariate spaces. Specifically,
	it includes: (1) an interactive feature selection method for identifying
	potentially interesting, multidimensional subspaces from a high-dimensional
	data space, (2) an interactive, hierarchical clustering method for
	searching multivariate clusters of arbitrary shape, and (3) a suite
	of coordinated visualization and computational components centered
	around the above two methods to facilitate a human-led exploration.
	The implemented system is used to analyze a cancer dataset and shows
	that it is efficient and effective for discovering unknown and unexpected
	multivariate patterns from high-dimensional data},

@article{WilkinsonAnandGrossman2006,
	Abstract = {We introduce a method for organizing multivariate displays and for guiding interactive exploration through high-dimensional data. The method is based on nine characterizations of the 2D distributions of orthogonal pairwise projections on a set of points in multidimensional Euclidean space. These characterizations include such measures as density, skewness, shape, outliers, and texture. Statistical analysis of these measures leads to ways for 1) organizing 2D scatterplots of points for coherent viewing, 2) locating unusual (outlying) marginal 2D distributions of points for anomaly detection, and 3) sorting multivariate displays based on high-dimensional data, such as trees, parallel coordinates, and glyphs.},
